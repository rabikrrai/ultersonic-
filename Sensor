ROS 2 Humble is officially supported on Ubuntu 22.04, but if you want to install it on Ubuntu 24.04, you can try the following approach. Since Ubuntu 24 is not officially supported yet, there might be compatibility issues, but this can still work.

### Steps to Install ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 24.04:

#### 1. *Set Locale*
Make sure your system supports UTF-8 locales:
bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8


#### 2. *Add the ROS 2 Repository*
Set up the sources and keys.

- First, add the repository to your source list:
bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -


- Add the repository to your source list (replace jammy with humble):
bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list'


#### 3. *Install ROS 2 Packages*
Update the package index and install ROS 2:

bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop


Alternatively, if you want a minimal installation:

bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-base


#### 4. *Environment Setup*
Source the setup file:

bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash


To automatically source it every time a new terminal is opened, you can add the line to your ~/.bashrc:

bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


#### 5. *Install Dependencies*
Some packages require Python3 colcon:

bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions


Install additional development tools:

bash
sudo apt install python3-rosdep2 python3-vcstool


#### 6. *Initialize rosdep*
Initialize rosdep to manage dependencies:

bash
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update


#### 7. *Test the Installation*
Run a simple ROS 2 command to ensure everything is working properly:

bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker


Since Ubuntu 24.04 is not officially supported, there could be some dependency or compatibility issues.
